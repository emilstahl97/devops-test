# DevOps Testing Project

This repository contains a series of DevOps technical assessment tasks designed to evaluate skills in Kubernetes, containerization, SQL and troubleshooting in a microservices environment.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three progressive tasks:

- **task-01**: Setting up a local Kubernetes environment with KIND
- **task-02**: Deploying a multi-component Todo application to Kubernetes
- **task-03**: Troubleshooting and fixing issues in the deployed application
- **task-04**: A final small test if you finish the others

All tasks depend on the previous task to be completed successfully.

## Estimated Completion Times

The entire assessment is designed to be completed within 3 hours:

- **task-01**: 30 minutes
- **task-02**: 1 hour
- **task-03**: 1.5 hours
- **task-04**: 5 minutes

## Prerequisites

To work with this project, you'll need:

- Docker
- kubectl
- KIND (Kubernetes IN Docker)
- Basic understanding of Kubernetes concepts
- Familiarity with containerization
- Node.js knowledge (for application modifications if needed)
- MariaDB/MySQL knowledge

## Getting Started

1. Fork this repository to your own GitHub account and **make it public** (this is required for assessment)
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine
3. Start with task-01 to set up your local Kubernetes environment
4. Proceed to task-02 to deploy the Todo application
5. Finally, move to task-03 to demonstrate your troubleshooting abilities
6. Commit and push your changes to your public GitHub repository
7. Share the URL of your public repository for assessment

Each task directory contains its own README with specific instructions. Document your work process and any issues you encountered in the repository to help us understand your approach.

## Assessment Goals

This project evaluates your ability to:

1. Set up and interact with Kubernetes environments
2. Deploy containerized applications to Kubernetes
3. Diagnose and resolve issues in distributed systems
4. Apply DevOps best practices to application deployment
